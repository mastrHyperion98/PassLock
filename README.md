# PasswordManager

PasswordManager is a project I started working on because I was tired of keeping my passwords in a notebook and I don't trust the cloud for remember my data. I wanted to focus on creating an application that I could use across my Windows and Linux environments so I decided to use JavaFX. I also wanted the data to be secure from prying eyes so all the passwords use AES256 encryption. This is mostly meant as a hobby application and the UI might be rough around the edges since I am mostly concerned with usability rather than UI appearances. This whole project is done mostly for myself, I do not really expect others to use it, but I will develop it in such a way that it can be used by anyone as easily as possible. 

# Releases

You can find the lastest JAR files for alpha and stable releases under the releases options from Github. In order to be able to execute the JAR you need to make sure that you have Java installed on your system. 

# Development

Development for PasswordManager is really simple. I try to avoid using External Libraries for trivial tasks, so the only pre-requisite that you need to get are:
* javafx-sdk-14.0.1
* sqlite-jdbc-3.30.1 
* java jdk 14.01

Setup of Java and JavaFX will largely depend on your operating system and your IDE of choice. I will not cover these here, I will assume that if you want to contribute or perhaps fork the project than you have some experience with Java and know how to set it up. 

# RoadMap

I will be eventually posting a road map link to a Trello board whenever, i get passed alpha building and decide to slow down development and focus on smaller but important features.
